# 🚗 Car Price Prediction (My First Complex ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my **first end-to-end Machine Learning project**, where I experimented with predicting used car prices.  
The project reflects my **learning journey** as I explore data science concepts step by step — from messy raw data to building predictive models.

I chose this problem because:
- Car price prediction is a **real-world challenge** used in dealerships, insurance, and resale platforms.  
- It requires handling **noisy, messy datasets** (missing values, categorical features, outliers).  
- It’s the perfect playground for learning **EDA, regression, and model benchmarking**.

---

## 🔍 What I Did
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**
  - Handled missing values and categorical variables.
  - Explored dataset structure and distributions.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Identified key drivers of car price (year, km driven, fuel type, transmission, etc.).
  - Visualized patterns and correlations using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

- **Modeling**
  - Built a baseline **Linear Regression** model.
  - Benchmarked against a **Random Forest Regressor** to capture non-linear effects.

- **Insights**
  - Year of manufacture and kilometers driven were the strongest predictors.
  - Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression by a significant margin.

## 📊 Results
- **Linear Regression** → Struggled with non-linear relationships.  
- **Random Forest** → Provided higher accuracy and better generalization.  

> 💡 Key Learning: *EDA + choosing the right model is just as important as coding the pipeline itself.*

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## ✨ Key Takeaways
- My first exposure to **feature engineering & preprocessing**.  
- Learned how to **stress-test models** and interpret results.  
- Discovered that **storytelling with data** matters as much as code.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  
👉 [Car Details Dataset][car details v4.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho/data) 

The dataset is licensed under **Database Contents License (DbCL) v1.0**.  
For licensing reasons, I have not re-uploaded the raw file here.  
Please download it directly from the Kaggle source if you’d like to run the notebook.

## 🧭 What’s Next?
This is just the beginning of my ML journey.  
Next, I want to explore:
- **XGBoost / Gradient Boosting** for better performance.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize models.  
- **Deployment** with Streamlit or Flask to make the model interactive.
